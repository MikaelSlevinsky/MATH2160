\chapter*{Preface}

These course notes are intended to offer a deep understanding of a set of classical topics in numerical analysis that may be covered in a single term of undergraduate study. They are designed to be accessible to undergraduates, self-contained, and complete. Certain sections of the notes are taken or inspired from other sources due to the excellent expository work found elsewhere. These sources include: a previous version of Shaun Lui's MATH 2160 Numerical Analysis notes at the University of Manitoba; the University of Oxford's Part A Numerical Analysis notes based on the book by S\"uli and Mayers~\cite{Suli-Mayers-03}; Gautschi's ``Numerical Analysis,''~\cite{Gautschi-12}; Fletcher's ``Practical Methods of Optimization,''~\cite{Fletcher-80-1,Fletcher-80-2}; and, course notes of Nick Trefethen and Sheehan Olver made available online.
